This  raises  the  question:\nwhat can be the basis of such exalted conceptions of meaning\nand value in a universe where, if current scientific orthodoxy\nis correct, our entire human existence is not much more than\na random blip on the face of the cosmos? To that question we\nnow turn.\n31\n\nThe Question\n\n\ndescribed as arising, in Kant’s phrase, from a ‘need of reason’.\n58\nAccording  to  Kant,  I  cannot  prove  (or  disprove)  God;  yet\nbecause it would be humanly impossible to devote my life to\nthe good if I thought I was striving after ‘a conception which\nat bottom was empty and had no object’, it is appropriate for\n‘the  righteous  man  to  say  “I  will  that  there  be  a  God  . . .  I\nfirmly abide by this and will not let this faith be taken from\nme”.’\nThe plea is for an acknowledgement that human beings, in\ntheir  vulnerability  and finitude,  need,  in  order  to  survive,\nmodes of responding to the world which go beyond what is\ndisclosed in a rational scientific analysis of the relevant phe-\nnomena.  Such  modes  of  response,  moreover,  are  character-\nistically expressed through practices whose value and resonance\ncannot be exhausted by a cognitive analysis of propositional\ncontents. Wittgenstein was fond of quoting Goethe’sIm Anfang\nwar die Tat –‘In the beginning was the Deed’. He also warned,\nin  the  closing  sentence  of  his  early  masterpiece  the Tractatus,\nthat ‘what we cannot speak of we must pass over in silence’.\nAltering  that final  phrase,  we  might  say  instead  that  the\ndomain that ‘cannot be spoken of ’ must be handled through praxis\n– the practice of spirituality.\n59\n\nCODA: INTIMATIONS OF MEANING\n\nThe Corn was Orient and Immortal Wheat, which never should be\nreaped nor was ever sown. I thought it had stood from everlasting to\neverlasting. The Dust and Stones of the Street were as Precious as\nGOLD . . . And yong Men Glittering and Sparkling Angels, and Maids\nstrange Seraphic Pieces of Light and Beauty! . . .

Friedrich\nNietzsche,  famous  for  his  announcement  of  the  ‘death  of\nGod’,  was  clear  that  humankind,  in  the  post-theistic  world,\nwould have to generate significance from within itself – and\nindeed  that  this  was  the  only  available  source  for  all  value:\n‘Ultimately man finds in things nothing but what he himself\nhas  imported  into  them:  the finding  we  call  science,  the\nimporting – art, religion, love, pride.’\n24\nThis conception of  meaning as endogenous – the  idea of\n\nMan as the creator and generator of the meaning of his own\n\nlife  –  has  plainly  had  a  vast  influence  on  our  modern  and\npostmodern  culture.  The  Nietzschean  vision  can  be  seen  as\nhaving three phases. The first is the idea of the ‘death of God’,\nwhich  appears  in  Die  Fröhliche  Wissenschaft  (The  Joyful  Science,\n1882). A madman lights a lantern at midday and runs into the\nmarket place crying that he seeks God. He is laughed at by the\natheists  who  are  standing  around:  ‘Did  he  get  lost?’,  they\nsneer. ‘Or has he gone on a journey, or emigrated?’ At length\nthe madman announces ‘We have killed him, you and I!’ And\nhe goes off round the churches of the town to sing a requiem\n– one that parodies the traditional text of the mass: instead of\na  prayer  for  God  to  grant  repose  to  the  dead,  it  becomes\n‘requiem  eternam  Deo’  –  God  himself  is  consigned  to  eternal\nrest.\n25\nOver a century later, the shock value of Nietzsche’s initial\nproclamation  has  faded  a  little.  Walking  round  the  ancient\n12\n\nOn\n\n the Meaning of Life\n\ncities of Western Europe, where typically less than 10 per cent\nof  the  people  now  attend  religious  services,  one  may  feel\nlike  echoing  the  madman’s  challenge:  ‘What  are  all  these\nchurches  now  if  they  are  not  the  tombs  and  sepulchres  of\nGod?’ The culture which once made religious observance so\ncentral  –  in  the  rites  of  birth,  marriage  and  death,  in  the\ncelebration of the changing seasons of sowing and harvest, in\nthe weekly gatherings of the community Sunday after Sunday,"
