So\nalthough  modern  scientists  may  often  ask  various  kinds  of\n‘why?’  questions  about  particular  structures  or  events,  the\nultimate  and  most  general  principles  taken  to  underlie  all\nphenomena  are  not  regarded  as  admitting  of  the  question\n‘why is it so?’ If we were to achieve a complete and unified\n6\n\nOn\n\n the Meaning of Life\n\ntheory  of  the  universe  (fulfilling  the  grand  philosophical-\ncum-scientific vision that links Descartes and Hume, Newton\nand  Einstein,  right  down  to  present-day  cosmologists  such\nas  Hawking),  such  a  theory  would  subsume  all  observable\nphenomena in the universe under the fewest and most com-\nprehensive  laws  or  principles;  but  as  to  why  these  principles\nobtain, this would have to remain, in Hume’s graphic phrase,\n‘totally shut up from human curiosity and inquiry’.\n12\n\nSo we have a problem about the modern hope for a grand\n\ncomprehensive physics that would be the ‘ultimate triumph\nof human reason’. It is an inspiring aim, but one which leaves\nit very unclear why it should be supposed that a super-theory\nlinking gravity and quantum physics might enable us to tackle\nthe ultimate question of ‘why it is that we and the universe\nexist’.

He envisaged a unified style\nof  explanation  based  ultimately  on  the  universal  laws  of\nmathematical  physics  that  governed  the  behaviour  of  all\nnatural  phenomena,  celestial  and  terrestrial  alike.  There  was\nno  room  for  any  irreducible  purposiveness  or  goal-seeking\ndeep down in nature.

But  even  if  there  were  to  be  only  one  such  candidate,  it\nwould  still  be  merely  the  only  possible  theory  given  that  the\nuniverse is as it is – which would still fall short of explaining\nwhy  there  should  be  a  universe  at  all.  Some  cosmologists\n(including Hawking) have speculated that the grand unified\ntheory ‘might be so compelling that it brings about its own\nexistence’;\n13\n  but  it  is  hard  to  take  this  seriously.  A  theory\ncannot generate a universe.\n\nSOMETHING RATHER THAN NOTHING\n\nThe  position  we  have  reached  is  that  while  science  aims  to\n\nprovide  as  complete  and  comprehensive  a  description  as  it\ncan of the universe, no matter how successful and unified the\ntheory it ends up with, it cannot explain why there should be\n7\n\nThe Question\n\n\na universe there to be explained. We collide with the ancient\nphilosophical question ‘Why is there something rather than\nnothing?’ and it seems clear on reflection that nothing within\nthe observable universe could really answer this. If there is a\nsolution to the ‘riddle of life in space and time’, it would have\nto  lie  outside  space  and  time.\n14\n\nHere  we  run  into  another\n\nblank wall: if any such solution must lie beyond the limits of\nthe  temporal  and  spatial  universe,  outside  the  ‘phenomenal\nworld’, as Immanuel Kant called it, then may it not be beyond\nthe horizon of what is humanly knowable? If there is a tran-\nscendent  realm  of  the  ‘noumenal’ –  something  beyond  the\nphenomena,  which  explains  why  we  and  the  universe  are\nhere – then there is a risk that there will be nothing whatever\nwe can coherently say about it.\nWe may have reached the limits of science here, but perhaps\nwe  have  not  necessarily  reached  the  limits  of  human  dis-\ncourse. There is a rich tradition of religious language, both in\nour Western culture and elsewhere, that grapples with the task\nof addressing what cannot be fully captured by even the most\ncomplete  scientific  account  of  the  phenomenal  world.  One\nmight say that it is the task of religious discourse to strain at\nthe limits of the sayable. Some kinds of theology, to be sure,\nhave  aimed  at  keeping  entirely  within  the  boundaries  of"
