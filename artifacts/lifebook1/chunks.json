For a fair\npart of the twentieth century it was common in much of the\nanglophone  world  to  dismiss  many  of  the  traditional  grand\n1\n\nOn\n\n the Meaning of Life\n\nquestions  of  philosophy  as  pseudo-questions.  People  who\nfelt  perplexed  by  the  ancient  puzzle  of  the  meaning  of  life\nwere firmly  reminded  that  meaning  was  a  notion  properly\nconfined  to  the  arena  of  language:  words  or  sentences  or\npropositions could be said to have meaning, but not objects\nor events in the world, like the lives of trees, or lobsters, or\nhumans. So the very idea that philosophy could inquire into\nthe meaning of life was taken as a sign of conceptual confu-\nsion.  The  solution  to  the  problem,  as  Ludwig  Wittgenstein\nonce remarked, would lie in its disappearance.\n2\nBut somehow the problem does not go away; the search for\nlife’s meaning, confused or not, retains as powerful a hold on\nus  as  ever.  The  characters  in  Douglas  Adams’  Hitchhiker  saga\nmay  seem  absurd  in  their  faith  that  a  supercomputer  could\nwrap  it  up  for  them,  and  hopelessly  vague  about  how  to\nformulate  the  problem  in  the first  place,  but  a  strong  sense\nremains that the ancient quest that has held so many in thrall\nis more than just a philosopher’s muddle.\nFor  our  human  existence  is  mysterious  –  something\nstrange,  frightening,  to  be  wondered  at.

Philosophy,  said\nAristotle, is the child of wonder;\n3\n and the capacity to be dis-\nturbed by what is ordinarily taken for granted is the hallmark\nof  that  questioning  spirit  that  is  inseparable  from  human\nnature itself. The human being is unique in that, as Heidegger\nput  it,  it  is  an  entity  for  whom  its  own  being  is  an  issue.  Or\nagain: ‘Man alone of all beings, when addressed by the voice of\nBeing, experiences the marvel of all marvels: that what-is is.’\n4\n\nWhat are we really asking when we ask about the meaning\n\nof life? Partly, it seems, we are asking about our relationship\nwith the rest of the universe – who we are and how we came\nto be here. One aspect of this is a scientific question about our\norigins.  To  which  the  answer,  only  recently  discovered,  is\n2\n\nOn\n\n the Meaning of Life\n\nbreathtaking:  we  came  from  the  stars.  If  we  manage  (the\nexperience  is  rarer  and  harder  now)  to find  a  spot  far  away\nfrom the city, where no seepage of noise and dazzle pollutes\nthe night, and look up in wonder at the vast and silent black-\nness of space from which numberless brilliant points of light\nshine down upon us, then what we see is the same material\nfrom  which  we,  and  everything  else  on  this  fragile  planet,\nwere  once  formed.  We  humans  are  part  of  the  cosmos:  not\njust as a pebble is part of a miscellaneous heap, not just as an\nitem on a haphazard inventory that happens to include what-\never the universe contains; but truly one with it, sharing its\ncommon origin, built of its stuff. We are formed of stardust.\nOf it, yet alienated from it? It may be so. The ancient Stoics\nthought  that  our  human  rationality  was  a  microcosm  of  a\ngoverning principle of Reason, the spiritual substance pervad-\ning  the  whole  cosmos;  centuries  later,  the  rationalist  phil-\nosopher Leibniz declared that ‘there is nothing waste, nothing\nsterile, nothing dead in the universe’.\n5\n\nBut the dominant view\n\nnowadays is that life and rationality are, cosmically speaking,\nlocal and untypical features of reality: nature is predominantly\nblind, irrational, dead. As the poet A. E. Housman lamented:\n. . . nature, heartless, witness nature,\n\nWill neither care nor know\n\nWhat stranger’s feet may cross the meadow\nAnd trespass there, and go.\n\nNor ask amid the dews of morning\n\nIf they are mine, or no.\n6",

And it is\nhard  to  see  how  such  judgements  about  the  significance  of\nour  lives  can  be  established  by  scientific  inquiry  alone.  To\nquote  Wittgenstein  again,  this  time  sounding  rather  more\nhospitable  to  our  grand  question,  ‘we  feel  that  even  when\nall  possible  scientific  problems  have  been  answered,  the\nproblems  of  life  have  not  been  put  to  rest’.\n7\n\nWhy  exactly\n\nshould this be so?\n\nSCIENCE AND MEANING\n\nScience  has  advanced  so  spectacularly  and  with  such  an\n\naccelerated  pace  in  the  last  century  or  so  that  we  may  be\ntempted  to  suppose  that  given  a  bit  longer  it  could  even\nsucceed  in  explaining  why  we  are  here  and  what  our  exist-\nence means. This appears to be the view of one of our most\ndistinguished contemporary scientists, Stephen Hawking:\nUp to now, most scientists have been too occupied with the\ndevelopment of new theories that describe \nwhat the universe\nis to ask the question \nwhy . . . However, if we discover a\ncomplete [and unified] theory [combining quantum physics\nwith general relativity] . . . we shall all . . . be able to take part\nin the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the\nuniverse exist.

But in\nfact  the  distinction  is  not  particularly  helpful  in  sorting  out\nwhat scientists characteristically do. Aristotle was rather more\nperspicuous in distinguishing four types of answer relevant to\nscientific inquiry:\n(1)  Answers indicating the component materials of which an\nobject is made (its ‘material’ cause);\n(2)  Answers specifying the essence or kind of thing it is (its\n‘formal’ cause);\n(3)  Answers pointing to the motive force that got it into its\npresent state (its ‘efficient’ cause); and\n(4)  Answers  citing  the  end  or  goal  towards  which  it  tends\n(its ‘final’ cause).\n9\n\nExplanations of all four kinds can be good scientific answers\n\nto the question ‘why?’\n(1)  ‘Why was the bridge strong?’ ‘Because [material] it was\nmade of steel.’\n(2)  ‘Why  do  you  classify  that  ice  cube  as  water?’ ‘Because\n[formal] it is frozen H\n2\nO.’\n(3)  ‘Why  did  the  billiard  ball  move?’ ‘Because  [efficient]  it\nwas struck with a cue.’\n(4)  ‘Why  do  trees  have  roots?’ ‘Because  [final]  in  order  to\ngrow they need to take up water and nutrients.’\n\nThe  last  type  of  answer  was  particularly  important  in\n\nAristotle’s  work,  since  he  maintained  that  all  things  tend\ntowards   some   natural   end-state;   but   although   modern\nscientists, especially biologists, still frequently use such goal-\nrelated or teleological explanations of phenomena, it has been\n5\n\nThe Question\n\n\na  guiding  principle  since  the  seventeenth  century  that  such\nteleology  must  always  eventually  be  explained  in  terms  of\nunderlying microstructures of an entirely mechanical nature.\n\nIt   is   in   this   sense   that   the   great   seventeenth-century\n\nphilosopher-scientist  René  Descartes  is  often  said  to  have\nbanished teleology from science.

The job of the scientist was to subsume\nall observable events under the relevant mathematical cover-\ning laws; and in respect of these ultimate laws there was no\nattainable answer to the question ‘why?’ One could say – and\nDescartes did say – that God had decreed that it should be so;\nbut he immediately added that the rationale for God’s decrees\nwas  not  for  human  scientists  to  discover:  it  was  ‘forever\nlocked  up  in  the  inscrutable  abyss  of  His  wisdom’.\n10\n\nDavid\n\nHume,  writing  a  century  after  Descartes,  took  an  essentially\nparallel line, though couched in entirely secular language: the\njob of science was to map the observable natural world, but\nany supposed ‘ultimate springs and principles’ of nature were\nbeyond human power to fathom.\n11\n\nAlthough  this  position  was first  established  by  the  philo-\n\nsophers  of  the  Enlightenment,  it  has  remained  pretty  much\nunshaken ever since; for it is hard to see how science, however\nit  may  develop,  could  address  such  ‘ultimate’  questions.  So\nalthough  modern  scientists  may  often  ask  various  kinds  of\n‘why?’  questions  about  particular  structures  or  events,  the\nultimate  and  most  general  principles  taken  to  underlie  all\nphenomena  are  not  regarded  as  admitting  of  the  question\n‘why is it so?’ If we were to achieve a complete and unified\n6\n\nOn\n\n the Meaning of Life\n\ntheory  of  the  universe  (fulfilling  the  grand  philosophical-\ncum-scientific vision that links Descartes and Hume, Newton\nand  Einstein,  right  down  to  present-day  cosmologists  such\nas  Hawking),  such  a  theory  would  subsume  all  observable\nphenomena in the universe under the fewest and most com-\nprehensive  laws  or  principles;  but  as  to  why  these  principles\nobtain, this would have to remain, in Hume’s graphic phrase,\n‘totally shut up from human curiosity and inquiry’.\n12\n\nSo we have a problem about the modern hope for a grand\n\ncomprehensive physics that would be the ‘ultimate triumph\nof human reason’. It is an inspiring aim, but one which leaves\nit very unclear why it should be supposed that a super-theory\nlinking gravity and quantum physics might enable us to tackle\nthe ultimate question of ‘why it is that we and the universe\nexist’.

But  even  if  there  were  to  be  only  one  such  candidate,  it\nwould  still  be  merely  the  only  possible  theory  given  that  the\nuniverse is as it is – which would still fall short of explaining\nwhy  there  should  be  a  universe  at  all.  Some  cosmologists\n(including Hawking) have speculated that the grand unified\ntheory ‘might be so compelling that it brings about its own\nexistence’;\n13\n  but  it  is  hard  to  take  this  seriously.  A  theory\ncannot generate a universe.\n\nSOMETHING RATHER THAN NOTHING\n\nThe  position  we  have  reached  is  that  while  science  aims  to\n\nprovide  as  complete  and  comprehensive  a  description  as  it\ncan of the universe, no matter how successful and unified the\ntheory it ends up with, it cannot explain why there should be\n7\n\nThe Question\n\n\na universe there to be explained. We collide with the ancient\nphilosophical question ‘Why is there something rather than\nnothing?’ and it seems clear on reflection that nothing within\nthe observable universe could really answer this. If there is a\nsolution to the ‘riddle of life in space and time’, it would have\nto  lie  outside  space  and  time.\n14\n\nHere  we  run  into  another\n\nblank wall: if any such solution must lie beyond the limits of\nthe  temporal  and  spatial  universe,  outside  the  ‘phenomenal\nworld’, as Immanuel Kant called it, then may it not be beyond\nthe horizon of what is humanly knowable? If there is a tran-\nscendent  realm  of  the  ‘noumenal’ –  something  beyond  the\nphenomena,  which  explains  why  we  and  the  universe  are\nhere – then there is a risk that there will be nothing whatever\nwe can coherently say about it.\nWe may have reached the limits of science here, but perhaps\nwe  have  not  necessarily  reached  the  limits  of  human  dis-\ncourse.

That enduring strand of natural theology has\nappealed to many philosophers over the centuries, though it\nhas suffered serious erosion in modern age from the success\nof rival non-theistic explanations of the relevant phenomena\n(in particular the triumph of Darwinism). But alongside this\n8\n\nOn\n\n the Meaning of Life\n\nquasi-scientific strand in theology, there is also a vast range of\nreligious  language  that  invokes  symbol,  metaphor,  poetry,\nnarrative,  and  other  elements  valued  for  their  supposed\nrevelatory  power  rather  than  for  their  strict  demonstrative\nforce;  religious  discourse  is  here  aimed  at  addressing  what\ncannot fully be put into words, at least into the words of our\nrational  scientific  culture,  but  which  can  still  somehow  be\nshown, disclosed, made manifest.\n15\n\nSuch   religious   discourse   gropes   towards   something\n\nbeyond the phenomenal world that may give meaning to the\nuniverse, and to our human lives. It may not provide a rational\nscientific solution to the old puzzle of why there is something\nrather  than  nothing,  for,  as  we  have  seen,  this  is  a  question\nwhich  may  lie  beyond  the  limits  of  systematic  knowledge.\n\nBut its advocates would urge that it none the less assuages the\n\nvertigo, the ‘nausea’, as Jean-Paul Sartre called it, that we feel\nin confronting the blank mystery of existence. The religious\nanswer  –  one  of  several  responses  to  the  problem  of  life’s\nmeaning  to  be  examined  in  the  pages  that  follow  –  aims  to\nlocate  our  lives  in  a  context  that  will  provide  them  with\nsignificance  and  value.

Freud himself regarded the solution offered by religion\nas  pandering  to  something  unhealthy  and  disordered  in  the\nhuman psyche:\nThe moment a man questions the meaning and value of life,\nhe is sick . . . By asking this question one is merely admitting\nto a store of unsatisfied libido to which something else must\nhave happened, a kind of fermentation leading to sadness and\ndepression.\n19\nBelief  in  God,  according  to  Freud’s  view  in  Civilisation  and  its\nDiscontents,  is  based  on  an  infantile  response:  the  terrifying\n‘feeling  of  helplessness’  in  childhood  aroused  the  ‘need\nfor  protection’  –  for  protection  through  love  –  which  was\nprovided by the father; and the recognition that this helpless-\nness  lasts  throughout  life  made  it  necessary  to  cling  to  the\nexistence of a Father, but this time a more powerful one.\n20\nThis  Freudian  diagnosis  has  been  highly  influential,  and\ncan  often  be  seen  as  informing  the  idea,  voiced  by  many\ncontemporary  atheists,  that  God  is  merely  a  projection\nformed in response to our human insecurities. But there are at\nleast two problems with this way of dismissing the religious\nimpulse. First, though the abject helplessness of the infant is\nan apt image of the fragility of the human plight, that fragility,\nas  Freud’s  own  analysis  confirms,  is  clearly  not  confined  to\ninfancy.

It  is  certainly  plausible  that  frail  and\ninsecure humans would want to project their need for secur-\nity onto a protective heavenly Father; but a religious believer\ncan equally maintain that since our true destiny lies in union\nwith  our  creator,  we  will  naturally  feel  insecure  and  restless\nuntil  we find  Him.  Indeed,  precisely  this  latter  theme  turns\nout to be the refrain of many ancient writers on theistic spiri-\ntuality: nata  est  anima  ad  percipiendum  bonum  infinitum,  quod  Deus  est;\nideo in eo solo debet quiescere et eo frui – ‘the soul is born to perceive\nthe infinite good that is God, and accordingly it must find its\nrest and contentment in Him alone’.\n22\n\nThe result of the debate\n\nover projection is thus a stand-off: the fact that humans feel\na  powerful  need  for  God’s  loving  protection  logically  says\nnothing either way about whether that protection is a reality.\nFor the sake of this phase of the argument, however, let us\nassume for the moment that there is no such divine reality –\nno objective correlative that could ground our search for life’s\nsignificance.

Friedrich\nNietzsche,  famous  for  his  announcement  of  the  ‘death  of\nGod’,  was  clear  that  humankind,  in  the  post-theistic  world,\nwould have to generate significance from within itself – and\nindeed  that  this  was  the  only  available  source  for  all  value:\n‘Ultimately man finds in things nothing but what he himself\nhas  imported  into  them:  the finding  we  call  science,  the\nimporting – art, religion, love, pride.’\n24\nThis conception of  meaning as endogenous – the  idea of\n\nMan as the creator and generator of the meaning of his own\n\nlife  –  has  plainly  had  a  vast  influence  on  our  modern  and\npostmodern  culture.  The  Nietzschean  vision  can  be  seen  as\nhaving three phases. The first is the idea of the ‘death of God’,\nwhich  appears  in  Die  Fröhliche  Wissenschaft  (The  Joyful  Science,\n1882). A madman lights a lantern at midday and runs into the\nmarket place crying that he seeks God. He is laughed at by the\natheists  who  are  standing  around:  ‘Did  he  get  lost?’,  they\nsneer. ‘Or has he gone on a journey, or emigrated?’ At length\nthe madman announces ‘We have killed him, you and I!’ And\nhe goes off round the churches of the town to sing a requiem\n– one that parodies the traditional text of the mass: instead of\na  prayer  for  God  to  grant  repose  to  the  dead,  it  becomes\n‘requiem  eternam  Deo’  –  God  himself  is  consigned  to  eternal\nrest.\n25\nOver a century later, the shock value of Nietzsche’s initial\nproclamation  has  faded  a  little.  Walking  round  the  ancient\n12\n\nOn\n\n the Meaning of Life\n\ncities of Western Europe, where typically less than 10 per cent\nof  the  people  now  attend  religious  services,  one  may  feel\nlike  echoing  the  madman’s  challenge:  ‘What  are  all  these\nchurches  now  if  they  are  not  the  tombs  and  sepulchres  of\nGod?’ The culture which once made religious observance so\ncentral  –  in  the  rites  of  birth,  marriage  and  death,  in  the\ncelebration of the changing seasons of sowing and harvest, in\nthe weekly gatherings of the community Sunday after Sunday,",

Just as, after the Buddha was dead, ‘his tremendous,\ngruesome shadow was still shown for centuries in a cave’, so,\nafter God is dead, ‘there may still be places for thousands of\nyears in which his shadow will be shown – and we still have\nto vanquish the shadow’.\n26\n\nTaking leave of God is not a simple\n\nprocess,  like  abandoning  belief  in  phlogiston  once  a  better\nscientific account of combustion comes along. Religious faith\ndoes not form an isolated corner of our conceptual map that\ncan  be  torn  off  without  affecting  the  main  picture;  instead\n(to  change  the  metaphor)  it  lies  at  the  centre  of  a  vast  web\nof beliefs and attitudes and feelings that are all subtly inter-\nconnected. Unravelling them, and coming to terms with the\nconsequences  of  that  unravelling,  must  involve  a  radical\nupheaval,  not  just  in  the  cognitive  sphere,  like  adjusting  or\nmodifying  a  scientific  hypothesis,  but  in  a  way  that  is  far\nmore primitive, implying a shift, often at a pre-rational level,\nin  fundamental  aspects  of  our  moral,  social,  aesthetic  and\npsychological  orientation  towards  reality.  Large  numbers  of\npeople  may  have  formally  abandoned  the  idea  of  God  as\n13\n\nThe Question\n\n\ncentral  to  their  world-view,  but  it  seems  that  for  relatively\nfew  does  this  feel  like  having  ‘arrived’;  many  instead  are\nleft  with  a  sense  of  vague  discomfort,  manifested  in  some\nby  a  disquiet  about  the  moral  direction  of  a  wholly  secular\nsociety,  in  others  by  intermittent  attraction  to  fashionable\nalternative modes of spirituality, in others again by a certain\nmelancholic  nostalgia  for  the  nourishment  and  stability  of\nthe  faith  which  no  longer  seems  an  option.

Instead, the\ncry  of  the  madman  is  imbued  with  passionate  yearning,  a\nfierce lament for the loss of ‘the holiest and most powerful of\nall  that  the  world  has  yet  owned’,  and  a  determination  to\nattempt the heroic task of constructing a human surrogate for\nthe defunct God. ‘Is not the greatness of this deed too great\nfor us?

The  world  we  have  to  inhabit  following\nthe  death  of  God  is  a  world  where,  in  the  poet  W.  B.  Yeats’\ncelebrated lines,\n\nWhatever flames upon the night\n\nMan’s own resinous heart has fed.\n31\n15\n\nThe Question\n\n\nMAN, THE MEASURE OF ALL THINGS?\nMan,  said  the  philosopher  Protagoras,  is  the  measure  of  all\nthings: of what is, that it is, and of what is not, that it is not.\n32\n\nSocrates had little trouble refuting that piece of pretentious-\n\nness. Pretentious it is, in its arrogance; the Psalmist’s cry ‘It is\nHe that hath made us and not we ourselves’,\n33\n whatever one\nmay think of the underlying creed, at least has the humility to\nacknowledge the basic truth that we exist in the universe as\nwholly contingent beings, dependent on a reality we did not\ncreate.  And  pretentious  too,  in  its  pseudo-profundity.  For\nthough Protagoras’ modern successors never tire of pointing\nout that\nthere is nothing deep down inside us except what we have put\nthere ourselves, no criterion that we have not created in the\ncourse of creating a practice, no standard of rationality that is\nnot an appeal to such a criterion, no rigorous argumentation\nthat is not obedience to our own conventions\n34\nthe fact remains that none of these human procedures would\nhave  any  use  or  value  unless  they  were  confronted  by  an\nindependent  non-human  reality  that  in  the  long  run  allows\nthose procedures that are effective to flourish, and eradicates\nthose  that  are  faulty.  We,  mankind,  are  not  the  measure  of\nwhether  a  given  plant  does  well  in  a  given  soil,  or  a  given\nengine  works  more  efficiently  than  another,  or  the  Earth\nrevolves annually around the Sun or vice versa.

Since  we  cannot  jump  outside  of  our  human\n16\n\nOn\n\n the Meaning of Life\n\nculture, inspect reality ‘as it really is’, and then jump back and\npronounce such and such a theory true and another false, we\nshould  acknowledge  that  we  always  have  to  operate  within\nthe context of a continuing dialogue with our peers, with no\ninstant hotline to the truth, no privileged access to a Golden\n\nRule  or  Procedure  that  will  guarantee  that  our  hypotheses\n\nfit reality. Yet to abandon the misguided hope for such guar-\nantees should not lead us to forget that human science aims at\ndiscovering  (or  eliminating)  realities  that  are  there  (or  not\nthere)  irrespective  of  anything  we  decide.  To  put  it  in  the\nmore  evocative  terminology  of  Yeats’  poem,  the  fuel  from\nour  own  ‘resinous  hearts’  does  not  after  all  ‘feed’  reality:  it\nilluminates, but  cannot  determine, what is there to be seen upon\nthe night.\nHow does this bear on Nietzsche’s heroic attempt to gener-\nate meaning from within? By supposing the unaided human\nwill can create meaning, that it can merely by its own resolute\naffirmation  bypass  the  search  for  objectively  sourced  truth\nand value, he seems to risk coming close to the Protagorean\nfallacy.  For  meaning  and  worth  cannot  reside  in  raw  will\nalone:  they  have  to  involve  a fit  between  our  decisions  and\nbeliefs  and  what  grounds  those  decisions  and  beliefs.

But  it  cannot  be  created  by  human fiat\nalone.\nThe  Nietzschean  solution,  in  short,  is  untenable;  and  one\nmay add that it is in any case inhuman, or at least inhumane.\n\nFor a philosophy that exalts raw will as the key to value and\n\nmeaning,  that  makes  salvation  dependent  on  the  kind  of\nheroic struggle, the greatest stress that can be endured only by\n17\n\nThe Question",

His  playing  gives  his  life  a  structure:\neach week he looks forward to the coming games, and feels\nsatisfied  when  they  go  well.  Clearly  he  has  not  found  ‘The\nMeaning of Life’, with capital letters.

To  describe  an  activity,  or\na  life,  as  meaningful  is  evidently  to  approve  or  commend\nit.  Now  there  are  many  people  who  have  come  to  think  of\nvaluing as a matter of subjective preference; indeed, sentences\nlike  ‘That’s  just  a  value  judgement!’  are  often  used  to  mean\nsomething like ‘That’s no more than your arbitrary personal\npreference!’  But  in  fact,  although  there  may  be  some  things\nwe  just  arbitrarily  ‘take  a  fancy  to’,  without  any  objective\nrhyme or reason,  typically we value things  in  virtue  of  objective\nfeatures  which  those  things  possess.  We  value  a  medicine\nbecause of its curative properties; we value a piece of music\nbecause it is uplifting, or relaxing, or beautifully harmonised;\nwe value a colleague because of her skill or good humour or\nintelligence. In short, value is typically grounded not in arbitrary\npreference but in objectively assessable features of the world.\nAnd  characteristically,  our  value  terms  reflect  this  ‘ground-\ning’ by being what philosophers term ‘thick’ concepts: they\ndon’t  just  say,  thinly,  ‘wow,  that’s  good!’,  but  rather  they\ncarry,  packaged-in  with  them  so  to  speak,  those  factual\nfeatures in virtue of which we judge the object to be good.\n37\nThus  concepts  like  ‘generous’  or  ‘courageous’  carry  with\nthem  a  package  or  checklist  of  qualifications  relevant  to  the\npositive evaluation – courage has to do with standing firm in\nthe  face  of  danger,  generosity  with  a  certain  liberal  attitude\n20\n\nOn\n\n the Meaning of Life\n\ntowards giving to others.

But  lining  up\nballs of torn up newspaper in neat rows cannot normally be\nmeaningful (except in some special context – maybe it keeps\none sane in a prisoner-of-war camp). This links with a second\nfeature:  to  be  meaningful  an  activity  must  be  achievement-\noriented, that is, directed towards some goal, or requiring some\nfocus of energy or concentration or rhythm in its execution.\n\nAimlessly throwing darts without any attempt to keep score\n\nor any concern for accuracy could not count as a meaningful\nactivity (again, in the absence of special circumstances).\n\nPerhaps the most salient feature of meaningfulness derives\n\nfrom  its  original  semantic  home  within  the  domain  of  lan-\nguage.

Can a radically immoral life be really\nmeaningful?\n\nMEANING AND MORALITY\n\nWe have already observed that the term ‘meaningful’ carries\nwith it a package of criteria for its appropriate use (there are\nproblems,  for  example,  in  describing  trivial  projects  or  the\nprojects of psychologically confused or unself-aware agents,\nas  meaningful).  We  are  now  asking  whether  the  life  of  the\ndedicated Nazi torturer can indeed qualify as meaningful, and\nthe only  way to answer this  is to unpack  the example more\ncarefully. If such a person is acting out of anger, resentment\nor a sense of inferiority, for example, it already looks as if they\nmay  be  falling  short  of  the  autonomy  and  selfhood  that  is\nnecessary for us to say that their projects represent their own\nunmanipulated choices about how best to live. A prostitute’s\nlife is not meaningful if her ‘choice’ to go on the streets is the\nacting  out  of  pain  and  confusion  arising  from  her  being  a\nvictim  of  childhood  abuse.  The  life  of  the  bully  who  serves\nthe Nazis because he ‘derives great satisfaction’ from hurting\nothers begins to looks less meaningful when we explore the\nbackground and find out that such satisfaction stems from a\ndamaged sense of self-worth produced by his upbringing at",

What holds good for artistic\nachievement  seems  to  hold  good  for  athletic,  technical  or\nintellectual achievement: the great athlete, the brilliant engin-\neer or the gifted mathematician may all feel they have found\nmeaning  in  their  projects  and  achievements,  and  may  be\njudged by those around them to lead meaningful lives. Yet in\nnone of these cases does it at first sight appear necessary that\nthe lives  in  question have  to be  morally decent  lives:  just as\nthe  artistic  genius  can  be  a  selfish  philanderer,  so  the  great\nathlete could be a thug, the brilliant engineer a tax dodger, the\ngifted mathematician a heartless miser, all apparently without\naffecting  the  meaningfulness  of  their  lives,  so  judged.  This\nbrings  out  a  disturbing  feature  of  the  pluralistic  account  of\nlife’s meaning provided by the brand of secular humanism we\nare considering. If there is no overarching structure or theory\nthat confers meaning on life, no normative pattern or model\nto which the meaningful life must conform, then a meaning-\nful life reduces to little more than an engaged life in which\nthe  agent  is  systematically  committed  to  certain  projects  he\nmakes his own, irrespective of their moral status.\nBut  this  is  not  quite  good  enough.  It  is  not  as  if  we  are\nspeculating  in  a  vacuum  about  disembodied,  deracinated\nbeings who have a clean slate on which to devise the plan that\nwill confer meaning on their lives.

I\nfirmly abide by this and will not let this faith be taken from\nme”.’\nThe plea is for an acknowledgement that human beings, in\ntheir  vulnerability  and finitude,  need,  in  order  to  survive,\nmodes of responding to the world which go beyond what is\ndisclosed in a rational scientific analysis of the relevant phe-\nnomena.  Such  modes  of  response,  moreover,  are  character-\nistically expressed through practices whose value and resonance\ncannot be exhausted by a cognitive analysis of propositional\ncontents. Wittgenstein was fond of quoting Goethe’sIm Anfang\nwar die Tat –‘In the beginning was the Deed’. He also warned,\nin  the  closing  sentence  of  his  early  masterpiece  the Tractatus,\nthat ‘what we cannot speak of we must pass over in silence’.\nAltering  that final  phrase,  we  might  say  instead  that  the\ndomain that ‘cannot be spoken of ’ must be handled through praxis\n– the practice of spirituality.\n59\n\nCODA: INTIMATIONS OF MEANING\n\nThe Corn was Orient and Immortal Wheat, which never should be\nreaped nor was ever sown.

The moral categories of our\nexperience,   so  closely   bound   up   with  the   question   of\nlife’s meaning, are not arcane or mystical categories, but are\ninseparable  from  our  human  way  of  being  in  the  world.\nInseparable, but not automatically achieved. When things go\nwrong,\nLife’s but a fleeting shadow, a poor player\nthat struts and frets his hour upon the stage\nand then is heard no more. It is a tale\ntold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\nsignifying . . . nothing.\n67",

It is a tale\ntold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\nsignifying . . . nothing.\n67\nMacbeth’s hell, his deep depression about his life and future,\nis bound up with a vivid sense of the collapse of any meaning\nin life. That in turn is triggered by his interior moral collapse,\nhis  capitulation  to  greed  and  ambition,  which  lets  him  take\nthe first step towards betrayal and murder: that capitulation,\nwhich was supposed to give him the crown and solve all his\nproblems, turned out to be the first step to ethical disintegra-\ntion,  the first  step  on  the  ‘primrose  path  to  the  everlasting\nbonfire’.  Human  beings  cannot  live  wholly  and  healthily\nexcept  in  responsiveness  to  objective  values  of  truth  and\nbeauty  and  goodness.  If  they  deny  those  values,  or  try  to\nsubordinate  them  to  their  own  selfish  ends,  they find  that\nmeaning slips away.\n\nPerhaps  there  are  some  who  can  achieve  a  systematic\n\nresponsiveness to these values without the kind of focus pro-\nvided  by  the  disciplines  of  spirituality;  but  the  argument  of\n103\n\nMeaning, Vulnerability and Hope\n\nthis book has been that such a ‘go it alone’ strategy is fraught\nwith  problems.  We  cannot  create  our  own  values,  and  we\ncannot  achieve  meaning  just  by  inventing  goals  of  our\nown; the fulfilment of our nature depends on the systematic\ncultivation of our human capacities for wonder and delight in\nthe beauty of the world, and the development of our moral\nsensibilities for compassion, sympathy and rational dialogue\nwith others. Yet, because of the fragility of our human condi-\ntion,  we  need  more  than  a  rational  determination  to  orient\nourselves  towards  the  good.  We  need  to  be  sustained  by  a\nfaith in the ultimate resilience of the good; we need to live in\nthe  light  of  hope.\n68\n  Such  faith  and  hope,  like  the  love  that\ninspires both, is not established within the domain of scien-\ntifically determinate knowledge, but there is good reason to\nbelieve it is available to us through cultivating the disciplines\nof  spirituality.  Nothing  in  life  is  guaranteed,  but  if  the  path\nwe follow is integrally linked, as good spiritual paths are, to\nright action and self-discovery and respect for others, then we\nhave little to lose; and if the claims of religion are true, then",
