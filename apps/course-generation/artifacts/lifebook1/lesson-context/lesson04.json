He  has  retired,  has  a  pension\nsufficient  for  his  needs,  is  reasonably  healthy,  and  enjoys\nabove all his thrice-weekly game of golf. Let us assume that he\nis  free  from  the  self-deception  and  social  manipulation  that\nblight  the  lives  of  some  of  his  fellow  members  of  the  local\nclub: he is not there as a social climber, or to make business\ncontacts, or to show off his expensive golfclubs; he just genu-\ninely  enjoys  the  game.  His  playing  gives  his  life  a  structure:\neach week he looks forward to the coming games, and feels\nsatisfied  when  they  go  well.  Clearly  he  has  not  found  ‘The\nMeaning of Life’, with capital letters. But why not say, quietly\nand in lower-case letters, that he has succeeded in finding a\nmeaning,  or  some  meaning,  to  his  life;  and  that  this,  and\ncountless   similar   stories   for   countless   other   individuals\nhappily absorbed in their own favoured pursuits, amounts to\nall that can be said, or needs to be said, on the matter?\n\nNotice  that  to  reach  this  seemingly  modest  conclusion\n\ncertain things need to be assumed. We’ve stipulated that Alan\nis comfortably off; and in this designation is included a whole\nnest  of  assumptions  about  a  certain  easy flow  to  his  life,  an\nabsence of too much anxiety and constraint about day-to-day\nliving,  an  available  measure  of  free  time,  and  an  ability  to\nexercise a degree of choice in the use of that time. We have\nalso stipulated that  he plays for the sheer  joy of the game –\nuninfluenced    by    demeaning    motives    like    vain    self-\nimportance, or a desire to crawl to the boss; and there is a host\nof further presuppositions here, this time about the extent to\n19\n\nThe Question\n\n\nwhich the chosen pursuit reflects Alan’s status as an autono-\nmous agent. If he was playing out of abject fear of losing his\njob, or because of a subconscious compulsion to surpass his\nfather’s  sporting  achievements,  then  we  would  be  more\ndoubtful in allowing he had found a meaning to his life – or\nat  least  the  favourable  implications  of  that  phrase  would  be\nput in question.\nThis last point brings out the fact that talk of ‘meaning’ in\nlife  is  inescapably  evaluative  talk.

Nietzsche, in the kind of rant\nthat  sporadically  mars  his  literary  and  philosophical  genius,\nfeverishly welcomed ‘the signs that a more manly, a warlike\nage is about to begin, an age which above all will give honour\nto  valour  once  again’.\n35\n\nOver  a  century  of  dire  experience\n\nlater, it would be good to hope that mankind is increasingly\nseeing  reason  to  prefer  the  more  mundane  virtues  of  com-\npromise and compassion, the less heroic but more democratic\nvalues rooted (historically) in the religious ethic of universal\nbrotherhood  that  Nietzsche  scorned.  But  this  postscript  on\nNietzsche will have to be left hanging for the moment, since\nit  raises  general  issues  about  the  connection  between  the\nquest for meaning and the foundations of morality that will\nneed more time to unravel.\nVARIETY, MEANING AND EVALUATION\n\nIf human beings cannot create meaning and value merely by\n\nan exercise of will, why can’t they nevertheless find meaning\nin  the  various  diverse  human  activities  and  projects  they\nundertake?  ‘Various’  and  ‘diverse’  are  the  key  words  here.\n\nPerhaps  the  difficulty  in  the  question  that  baffled  the  Hitch\n\nHiker  philosophers  Loonquawl  and  Phouchg  was  that  they\n\nwere looking for the meaning – a single grand all-encompass-\ning answer. That, of course, is the way most religious thinkers\nhave  traditionally  seen  it.  But  perhaps  we  need  to  get  away\nfrom  this  spell,  and  to  adopt  instead  a  more  modest,  piece-\nmeal approach, more in tune with the metaphysically lower-\nkey aspirations of what one might call contemporary secular\nhumanism. Perhaps, as Isaiah Berlin has neatly put it:\n18\n\nOn\n\n the Meaning of Life\n\nThe conviction . . . that there exists . . . a discoverable goal, or\npattern of goals, the same for all mankind . . . is mistaken;\nand so too is the notion that is bound up with it, of a single\ntrue doctrine carrying salvation to all men everywhere’.\n36\nConsider  Alan,  a  golfer.

To  describe  an  activity,  or\na  life,  as  meaningful  is  evidently  to  approve  or  commend\nit.  Now  there  are  many  people  who  have  come  to  think  of\nvaluing as a matter of subjective preference; indeed, sentences\nlike  ‘That’s  just  a  value  judgement!’  are  often  used  to  mean\nsomething like ‘That’s no more than your arbitrary personal\npreference!’  But  in  fact,  although  there  may  be  some  things\nwe  just  arbitrarily  ‘take  a  fancy  to’,  without  any  objective\nrhyme or reason,  typically we value things  in  virtue  of  objective\nfeatures  which  those  things  possess.  We  value  a  medicine\nbecause of its curative properties; we value a piece of music\nbecause it is uplifting, or relaxing, or beautifully harmonised;\nwe value a colleague because of her skill or good humour or\nintelligence. In short, value is typically grounded not in arbitrary\npreference but in objectively assessable features of the world.\nAnd  characteristically,  our  value  terms  reflect  this  ‘ground-\ning’ by being what philosophers term ‘thick’ concepts: they\ndon’t  just  say,  thinly,  ‘wow,  that’s  good!’,  but  rather  they\ncarry,  packaged-in  with  them  so  to  speak,  those  factual\nfeatures in virtue of which we judge the object to be good.\n37\nThus  concepts  like  ‘generous’  or  ‘courageous’  carry  with\nthem  a  package  or  checklist  of  qualifications  relevant  to  the\npositive evaluation – courage has to do with standing firm in\nthe  face  of  danger,  generosity  with  a  certain  liberal  attitude\n20\n\nOn\n\n the Meaning of Life\n\ntowards giving to others. Granted for the moment that ‘mean-\ningful’ is one of these thick concepts – and it certainly seems\nto be, since to call a life meaningful is not just thinly to say\n‘wow,  it’s  great!’  but  to  commend  it  in  virtue  of  some\nspecific  features  you  can  point  to  –  let  us  ask  what  is  the\npackage typically associated with this term.\n\nWHAT MEANINGFULNESS IMPLIES\n\nIn  the first  place,  to  call  an  activity  or  a  life  meaningful\nnormally  implies  a  certain  profundity  or  seriousness  (though\n‘serious’ here need not at all imply ‘solemn’). Pursuits can be\nmeaningful  in  a  more  or  less  deep  way,  but  not,  as  it  were,\nin  a  shallow  way;  so  to  appraise  something  as  meaningful"
