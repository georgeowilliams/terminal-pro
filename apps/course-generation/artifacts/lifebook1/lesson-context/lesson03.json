Just as, after the Buddha was dead, ‘his tremendous,\ngruesome shadow was still shown for centuries in a cave’, so,\nafter God is dead, ‘there may still be places for thousands of\nyears in which his shadow will be shown – and we still have\nto vanquish the shadow’.\n26\n\nTaking leave of God is not a simple\n\nprocess,  like  abandoning  belief  in  phlogiston  once  a  better\nscientific account of combustion comes along. Religious faith\ndoes not form an isolated corner of our conceptual map that\ncan  be  torn  off  without  affecting  the  main  picture;  instead\n(to  change  the  metaphor)  it  lies  at  the  centre  of  a  vast  web\nof beliefs and attitudes and feelings that are all subtly inter-\nconnected. Unravelling them, and coming to terms with the\nconsequences  of  that  unravelling,  must  involve  a  radical\nupheaval,  not  just  in  the  cognitive  sphere,  like  adjusting  or\nmodifying  a  scientific  hypothesis,  but  in  a  way  that  is  far\nmore primitive, implying a shift, often at a pre-rational level,\nin  fundamental  aspects  of  our  moral,  social,  aesthetic  and\npsychological  orientation  towards  reality.  Large  numbers  of\npeople  may  have  formally  abandoned  the  idea  of  God  as\n13\n\nThe Question\n\n\ncentral  to  their  world-view,  but  it  seems  that  for  relatively\nfew  does  this  feel  like  having  ‘arrived’;  many  instead  are\nleft  with  a  sense  of  vague  discomfort,  manifested  in  some\nby  a  disquiet  about  the  moral  direction  of  a  wholly  secular\nsociety,  in  others  by  intermittent  attraction  to  fashionable\nalternative modes of spirituality, in others again by a certain\nmelancholic  nostalgia  for  the  nourishment  and  stability  of\nthe  faith  which  no  longer  seems  an  option.  In  Nietzsche’s\neyes,  it  is  as  if  mankind  has  acquired  a  debilitating  depen-\ndency on the accumulated capital from its religious heritage,\nand  learning  to  live  without  the  weekly  remittance  will  not"

Friedrich\nNietzsche,  famous  for  his  announcement  of  the  ‘death  of\nGod’,  was  clear  that  humankind,  in  the  post-theistic  world,\nwould have to generate significance from within itself – and\nindeed  that  this  was  the  only  available  source  for  all  value:\n‘Ultimately man finds in things nothing but what he himself\nhas  imported  into  them:  the finding  we  call  science,  the\nimporting – art, religion, love, pride.’\n24\nThis conception of  meaning as endogenous – the  idea of\n\nMan as the creator and generator of the meaning of his own\n\nlife  –  has  plainly  had  a  vast  influence  on  our  modern  and\npostmodern  culture.  The  Nietzschean  vision  can  be  seen  as\nhaving three phases. The first is the idea of the ‘death of God’,\nwhich  appears  in  Die  Fröhliche  Wissenschaft  (The  Joyful  Science,\n1882). A madman lights a lantern at midday and runs into the\nmarket place crying that he seeks God. He is laughed at by the\natheists  who  are  standing  around:  ‘Did  he  get  lost?’,  they\nsneer. ‘Or has he gone on a journey, or emigrated?’ At length\nthe madman announces ‘We have killed him, you and I!’ And\nhe goes off round the churches of the town to sing a requiem\n– one that parodies the traditional text of the mass: instead of\na  prayer  for  God  to  grant  repose  to  the  dead,  it  becomes\n‘requiem  eternam  Deo’  –  God  himself  is  consigned  to  eternal\nrest.\n25\nOver a century later, the shock value of Nietzsche’s initial\nproclamation  has  faded  a  little.  Walking  round  the  ancient\n12\n\nOn\n\n the Meaning of Life\n\ncities of Western Europe, where typically less than 10 per cent\nof  the  people  now  attend  religious  services,  one  may  feel\nlike  echoing  the  madman’s  challenge:  ‘What  are  all  these\nchurches  now  if  they  are  not  the  tombs  and  sepulchres  of\nGod?’ The culture which once made religious observance so\ncentral  –  in  the  rites  of  birth,  marriage  and  death,  in  the\ncelebration of the changing seasons of sowing and harvest, in\nthe weekly gatherings of the community Sunday after Sunday,"
