What holds good for artistic\nachievement  seems  to  hold  good  for  athletic,  technical  or\nintellectual achievement: the great athlete, the brilliant engin-\neer or the gifted mathematician may all feel they have found\nmeaning  in  their  projects  and  achievements,  and  may  be\njudged by those around them to lead meaningful lives. Yet in\nnone of these cases does it at first sight appear necessary that\nthe lives  in  question have  to be  morally decent  lives:  just as\nthe  artistic  genius  can  be  a  selfish  philanderer,  so  the  great\nathlete could be a thug, the brilliant engineer a tax dodger, the\ngifted mathematician a heartless miser, all apparently without\naffecting  the  meaningfulness  of  their  lives,  so  judged.  This\nbrings  out  a  disturbing  feature  of  the  pluralistic  account  of\nlife’s meaning provided by the brand of secular humanism we\nare considering. If there is no overarching structure or theory\nthat confers meaning on life, no normative pattern or model\nto which the meaningful life must conform, then a meaning-\nful life reduces to little more than an engaged life in which\nthe  agent  is  systematically  committed  to  certain  projects  he\nmakes his own, irrespective of their moral status.\nBut  this  is  not  quite  good  enough.  It  is  not  as  if  we  are\nspeculating  in  a  vacuum  about  disembodied,  deracinated\nbeings who have a clean slate on which to devise the plan that\nwill confer meaning on their lives. We are talking about human\nlives – the lives of a very special kind of animal, subject to an\narray of interlinked imperatives – biological imperatives (for\nfood,  warmth,  shelter,  procreation),  social  imperatives  (the\nneed  to  cooperate,  the  drive  to  communicate),  emotional\nimperatives (the need for such things as mutual recognition\nand affection), and lastly and just as importantly what might\n26\n\nOn\n\n the Meaning of Life\n\nbe called ‘rational imperatives’. Uniquely among known living\nthings  we  are  capable  of  standing  back  from  our  environ-\nment, questioning the way things are, challenging the actions"

To  be  sure,  the\nunhealthy choices and actions described in these sorts of case\nhave a certain sort of significance, just as the stunted growth\nof a plant sown in polluted ground is significant – it points to\n24\n\nOn\n\n the Meaning of Life\n\nsomething that has gone awry. But it would be wrong to infer,\njust because the agents find some kind of satisfaction in their\nactivities, that these lives qualify as meaningful in the richer\nevaluative  sense  we  have  identified  as  belonging  to  the\npackage typically associated with the label ‘meaningful’ – the\nsense  that  implies  an  agent’s  involvement  in  projects  that\nreflect his or her free and autonomous choices.\n\nBut  could  there  not  be  a  completely  immoral  life  that\n\nnone  the  less  reflected  the  wholly  unmanipulated  rational\nchoices of the agent? Could not the rational immoralist – that\nfamiliar figure  from  philosophical  discussions  of  the  old\nquestion  ‘Why  should  one  be  moral?’  –  enjoy  a  perfectly\nmeaningful life? If we make the case one of excessive or per-\nverted cruelty and inhumanity, then we may be drawn back\ninto  questions  about  the  psychological  equilibrium  of  the\nagent; so let us stipulate instead that the immoralist we have in\nmind  is  no  monster  of  vice,  nor  victim  of  gross  childhood\ntrauma,  but  is  instead  just  very,  very  selfish  –  and  selfish,\nmoreover, in a way that signally promotes his chosen projects.\nHe might be like Percy Berkeley, the gourmandising officer in\nSimon Raven’s Alms for Oblivion sequence, who ‘had not had a\nthought in his head for twenty years that was not connected\nwith his own immediate pleasure or comfort’.\n40\n\nTo make the\n\ncase  even  harder,  let  us  assume  that  the  chosen  projects  are\nvery much more impressive than the shallow indulgences of\nthe  bon  viveur,  amounting  instead  to  projects  of  great  cre-\native significance. The much discussed case of Paul Gauguin,\nwho  selfishly  dumped  his  family  to  pursue  a  self-indulgent\nbut  highly  creative  life  in  Tahiti,  is  the  case  of  someone\nnow widely regarded as a painter of genius;\n41\n and (our critic\nmight ask) if the life of an artistic genius is not meaningful,\nwhose is?\n25\n\nThe Question"

This need not mean that\nin a meaningful life any moral value always has to override all\nother  values:  perhaps  no  one  could  be  a  successful  artist  or\nscientist  or  athlete  if  they  were  so  saintly  as  to  sacrifice  all\ntheir  time  and  resources  to  the  needs  of  others.  But  it  does\nmean that the meaningful life for human beings is an integrated\nlife – one where my pet projects and plans are not kept in an\nisolated category which allows me to pursue them perpetu-\nally shielded from the demands on me as a parent, or a friend,\nor a colleague, or a citizen. Though I may of course have my\nown special priorities and goals – as I must do, if my life is to\nbe genuinely my own, if I am to be a human agent, not a mere\ninsect in the social hive –\n44\n nevertheless the walls created by\nthose priorities will never become so thick as to allow me to\ndomineer like a tyrant within the domain of my own creative\nself-importance.\nSo  what  of  the  Gauguin-type figure?

Well,  it  would  be  naive  and  silly  to  deny  that  great\nartists often behave badly. Both Tolstoy and Dickens, though\nthey  were  in  a  certain  sense  ‘family  men’,  could  in  some\nrespects be regarded as husbands from hell. The claim is not\nthat  a  meaningful  life  can  only  be  one  of  untiring  virtue:\nlapses  and  failures  of  all  kinds  are  a  universal  feature  of  all\nhuman lives, as prevalent among the great as they are among\nthe ordinary. Indeed, they may be more prevalent, since the\ndetermination  required  to  excel  perhaps  needs  the  kind  of\nsingle-mindedness that has a certain kinship to raw egoism.\n\nBut one can concede this obvious truth without succumbing\n\nto  the  muddled  romantic  fantasy  that  greatness  somehow\nrequires or justifies callousness. All the evidence surely points\nthe  other  way;  for  great  art  is  great  precisely  because  of  its\nhumanity –  its  heightened  vision  of  the  pathos  and  tragedy\nand comedy and precariousness of the human condition; and"
